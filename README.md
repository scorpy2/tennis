# README

We care about tennis. We really do :) This is our attempt to collect, save and share
all the tennis scores (mostly amateur tennis), we even have taken part in some
of these games. This is our tennis history.

We have chosen:

* Ruby 2.6.0

* Puma, nginx on Debian 9 (Linode)

* Just fetch the source, bundle install and you're set

* Database: PostgreSQL 10

* Database initialization: rails db:migrate && db:seed

* Testing: rspec

* Services we are about to use: RabbitMQ, cloudfront

* Deployment instructions: routine capistrano 3 (wip)
